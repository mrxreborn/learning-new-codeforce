x=int(input())
t=y=0
for x in range(x):
	d,u=map(int,input().split())
	t=t+(u-d)
	y=max(t,y)
print(y)

```
First declare the t and y value as 0
t is just assgining it self the new value comes from u-d
and after that, y just assigning itself the max value between t(new value) and y(we assigned it zero before.)

The program will work like this, as for this inputs 
4
0 3
2 5
4 2
4 0
when t = 0 -> t=t+(u-d) -> t=0+(3-0) -> 3; now, t = 3
  y=max(t,y) -> max (3,0) -> 3; now y=3
  
when t = 3 -> t=t+(u-d) -> t=3+(5-2) -> 6; now, t = 6
y=max(t,y) -> max (6,3) -> 6; now y=6
```
